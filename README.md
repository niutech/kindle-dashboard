Kindle Dashboard
================

Turn you old Amazon Kindle 3 (Keyboard) into an efficient e-paper dashboard showing: the current date &amp; time, to-do list, Google News headlines, Airly air quality and Meteo weather forecast. No jailbreak needed!

Just upload the index.html to your own host, having changed RSS feed sources before (using your own CORS proxy). Then [disable Kindle screensaver](https://almost-a-technocrat.blogspot.com/2012/01/how-to-disable-amazon-kindle-keyboard.html), start the experimental web browser on Kindle and go to your own  hosted dashboard ([here is mine](http://juvenia.info/kindle/)).

The dashboard auto-refreshes its air measurement every hour, news and weather forecast every 4 hours by default and 2 to-do lists are automatically saved in a cookie on change.

If you provide a [full text RSS feed](https://www.freefullrss.com/), its content preview will be shown in a pop-up window, without loading the full website.
